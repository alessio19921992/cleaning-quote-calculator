# Cleaning Quote Calculator 🧼💰

This is the **first Python program I’ve ever written**, even if it is really simple and beginner, it is exciting for me!

It's a simple tool that calculates cleaning service quotes based on the number of hours worked, with a 20% discount applied for first-time clients. I built it from scratch while learning Python step-by-step.

🔧Features

- Takes user input for number of hours
- Asks if it's the client's first clean
- Applies a 20% discount if it's their first time
- Outputs a clean summary with original price, discount, and final price

🐍 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Download the file `cleaning_quote_calculator.py`
3. Run it in your terminal or any Python environment:

```bash
python cleaning_quote_calculator.py
